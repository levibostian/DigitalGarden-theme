# DigitalGarden-theme

Hugo theme I use for my Digital Garden (aka: [my personal site](https://levi.earth)). 

This theme is *opinionated* and *evolving*. Feel free to use it for your own project but know that I may make drastic changes at any time to suite my own needs. I recommend that you fork this project for your own needs instead of using this one directly. 

> Note: This is currently a work in progress. Check for releases to know when it's ready to be used. 

# Features 

*Note: The list below are mostly ideas at this point. After some experimenting with each, the feature may be removed and not completed.* 

- [ ] Fast. As slim as possible. Goal of 100 lighthouse score. 
- [ ] Site works without javascript. Example: click on images and it brings up another tab with the full size image. 
- [X] Responsive, mobile first. 
- [X] Static. No javascript required (although, javascript can be used to enhance the site). 
- [X] Privacy focused. No tracking. 
- [ ] RSS link. Link populated with new pages and updated pages. 
- [ ] Web pages, no blog for content. This is a digital garden where the pieces in the site are always evolving. 
- [ ] Tag system for pages and blog posts to find pages, easily. 
- [X] Light/dark theme via CSS. 
- [ ] PostCSS. Makes working with browser pre-fixes easier. 
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting (because I am a geek). 
- [ ] `*` Version controlled content where you can view a piece of content through all it's updates. This is an optional feature that may never come to light, but it would be neat.
- [ ] Source maps uploaded to server. Anyone who wants to open dev tools in the browser can have fun viewing the code ðŸ˜„. 
- [ ] Resource caching. Not sure how we will enable caching yet, but limiting the number of network requests is helpful. 

> `*` indicates this is an optional, nice to have feature that may never happen.
